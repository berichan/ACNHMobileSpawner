# ACNHMobileSpawner

Item injector for Animal Crossing: New Horizons for mobile built in Unity. 
Requires a Switch running [Atmosphere](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere) if using the background service, with the plugin [sys-botbase](https://github.com/olliz0r/sys-botbase) or [USB-Botbase](https://github.com/fishguy6564/USB-Botbase) installed.

Refer to the Wiki for [troubleshooting](https://github.com/berichan/ACNHMobileSpawner/wiki) or for more information on [using USB-Botbase](https://github.com/berichan/ACNHMobileSpawner/wiki/USB-botbase)

Based heavily on [NHSE](https://github.com/kwsch/NHSE).

You run this at your own risk, I'm not responsible for anything.

### Android and iOS builds

The application requires an Android device running at minimum Android 4.4 (KitKat) with support for OpenGLES2.

Builds are not guaranteed to be stable. You may download the [apk or ipa files here](https://github.com/berichan/ACNHMobileSpawner/releases).

iOS builds are auto-built and untested, but I've been told they work.

### Notes

Some code was deleted and had to be rebuilt using ILSpy. I've done my best to clean up the classes affected, but they will be uncommented, minus ILSpy warnings I've kept in just to know what was affected.
